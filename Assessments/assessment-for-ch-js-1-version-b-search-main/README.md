# JavaScript 1B Assessment

**Do not share this repo or post any parts of it publicly. App Academy will take
violations very seriously.**

This assessment aims to evaluate your knowledge of JavaScript's basic and
intermediate features. You will not be tested on HTML Canvas, AJAX, or
Underscore templates.

You have **80 minutes.** The specs live in the __spec/__ directory. Your
code should go in the __src/__ directory in the file provided. Problems
are described in that file.

**Note:** When writing global functions (i.e., functions **not** defined on a
prototype), please use a **function declaration** rather than a function
expression; otherwise some specs will not work. See example below:

```js
// Function Declaration (USE THIS)
function foo() {}

// Function Expression (**DON'T** USE THIS)
const foo = function() {};
```

## Running specs

How to run the specs: open up __SpecRunner.html__ in a browser.

## Passing score

The passing score for this assessment is 28/35 specs.
The allotted time for this assessment is 80 minutes.
